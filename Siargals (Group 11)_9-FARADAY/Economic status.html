             <h6>Economy</h6>
             <p> Siargao Island attracts tourists more through its attractions and nature than through its products. However, Siargao is an island in the eastern Philippines where the residents previously depended heavily on coconut plantations and fishing for a living and have an average monthly income of 7,000 PHP. However, the value of coconuts as a commodity is quite low, and declining fish numbers have made fishing an unreliable source of revenue. Siargao fishermen have discovered that catches are decreasing and less regular.

                <h6>Tourism</h6>
<p> Siargao's tourism industry is expanding. General Luna, which is the major tourist village, had dozens of hotels and a few restaurants when the association was founded on the island in 2010. Although development was gradual for a while, the construction of a road that connects the main towns in 2015 changed the course of tourism expansion. As a result, the majority of Siargao's residents now rely on tourism as their main source of income.
<br><br>
Tourism development has its advantages (increase in jobs, hotels and living standards) and its disadvantages (price increases, sale of land, increase in waste).The bulk of businesses are owned by foreigners or mixed families, which accounts for the recent surge in property value. Then again, some local families have maintained a hotel or restaurant for many years.

       <p>
        Because of its gorgeous, unspoiled natural environment and the fact that it features the best, most famous surf beach in the Philippines, some small-scale resort developers may see Siargao as a tourist destination. Airlines noticed the opportunity, and commercial turboprop operators like Cebu Pacific Air were well-positioned to capitalize on it because they had ATR aircraft that could take off and land on Siargao's 1400m-long airport runway.
        <br><br>
        Because of the ATR's lower trip expenses, Cebu Pacific was able to operate to Siargao profitably even with low passenger volumes.

        <h5>BEST TIME TO GO</h5>
        <h6>Dry Season - March to September</h6>
        <p>If you are interested in other water sports besides surfing, these are the best months to visit. Due to the lack of rain during this time, it is ideal for a swim, an island-hopping tour, or exploring the beautiful beaches and islets that every beach lover cannot resist and completely enjoy.
            </p>
        <h6> Surfing Season - July to November</h6>
          <p> For surfers, the best time to visit Siargao is during these months as well and wind conditions will definitely give you the best waves to ride. The annual Siargao International Surfing Cup, a watersport competition, is also held every September, which is a good event for those who want to witness the best in the sport compete against each other.
