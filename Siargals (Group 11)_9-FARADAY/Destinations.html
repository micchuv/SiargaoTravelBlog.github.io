        <h3>CLOUD 9</h3>
            <p>One of the well-known tourist destinations on Siargao Island is Cloud 9 , which is recognized as the
                 best surf break in the Philippines. The Cloud 9 Pier is one of the most popular spots to hang out 
                 at, surf or watch the pros do their thing. Cloud 9 is situated near General Luna, the island's
                  main tourist hub in the southeast. </p>

        <h3>MAGPUPUNGKO ROCK POOLS</h3>
            <p> On Siargao's east coast, in the province of Surigao del Norte, the town of Pilar is home to 
                the Magpupungko rock pools, which are natural tide pools. There are several small caves to 
                explore around the rock pools, as well as steep but barren hills to climb. Aside from the 
                pools, the big boulder that precariously perches on a flat stone is the most well-known rock
                 structure along the coast. A dramatic rock formation on the edge of the pool is composed of 
                 a large rock that appears to be squatting on another rock. 'Pungko' in Visayan means to squat.
                  Thus, the name Magpupungko. </p>

        <h3>MAASIN RIVER</h3>
            <p>The Maasin River has become a famous Siargao tourist spot for its bent palm tree rope swing. 
                This is the place where you can take a rope swing and canoe riding. One of the many places
                 where you can sail a canoe leisurely down the Maasin River and arrive at a spot where you
                 can cool off and unwind in their secret pool. </p>

        <h3>GUYAM ISLAND</h3>
            <p>Guyam Island is one of the three islands located in the Surfing Capital of the Philippines, Siargao.
                 It is one of the three popular islands that are visited in Siargao (the other two are Naked Island
                  and Daku Island. It is an islet with a small stretch of powdery-white sand and coconut trees 
                  scattered about, as well as interesting coral rock formations that are excellent for snorkeling.
                   The rest of the island (facing the Pacific) is battered with rocks.</p>

        <h3>DAKU ISLAND</h3>
            <p>The charming Daku Island is a must-see during your trip to Siargao. With white sand, lush palm trees, 
                and sparkling blue water, Daku Island is the definition of a tropical paradise. It’s also one of 
                the only remote islands inhabited by a few families, so it’s a great destination if you want a taste of
                 authentic Filipino culture.</p>

        <h3>SUGBA LAGOON</h3>
            <p>Sugba Lagoon is a hidden gem and a must-visit when in Siargao. You can get here on a day trip from General 
                Luna by cruising through the Del Carmen Mangrove Reserve in a Bangka (Filipino outrigger boat). This 
                lagoon features the most translucent and turquoise water, as well as stand-up paddleboarding, kayaking, 
                and other activities.</p>
